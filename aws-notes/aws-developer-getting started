cloud watch - set alarms and notifications in response to events. set alarms based on service metric thresholds
alert destinations can easly be set using simple notification service. apart from sns we can also use
auto scaling actions for triggered alarms.

SNS
    companions to cloud watch. main structure in sns is topic. topic is used to create a arn that can then have
    notifications send to it. then we can subscribe to topic using email or sms and any notification send to that
    sns topic will be forwarded to subscribed end points. topics are region specific and can only be notified by
    alarms in the same region.

IAM
    apply policies to groups rather than individual users.

Elastic cloud compute
    virtual machine service that runs software of your choice.

VPC
    create virtual private networks inside aws services.

    - Security groups
        defines incoming / outgoing ip addresses and ports. kind of like a mini firewall. its attached at the
        instance level and can be shared across many instances.

    - Routing tables
        configure routing destination for traffic coming out of vpc. each vpc has one routing table.

    - Network Access Control List
        each vpc has one access control list. acts as an ip filtering table. specifies which ips allowed
        through vpc for incoming and outgoing traffic.
