every aws region has one default vpc, which was created automatically by aws.
DHCP option set is associated with aws account. we can have multiple dhcp option sets but a single vpc
can only have one dhcp option set.

Route table
    Each subnet has got a route table.

A subnet can be public subnet if it connected to internet gateway.
there is a 1 - 1 mapping between internet gateways and vpcs.

elastic ip - needs to explicitly create and associate with instance or network interface
required for reliable persistent public facing ip address. we an assign elastic ips to instances
or network interface.


limit of elastic ips 5 per vpc.


Connecting private subnets to internet
    its done using NAT instance which is part of public subnet.
    the only traffic allowed in is the response to what we send. ie NAT is instance only allow
    stateful responses.

    NAT instances has got source and destination checks. isable that check.
