Cloud computing charecteristics

    - On demand = get what you need when you need it.
    - Broad network acces = you have access private, public and internet.
    - Resource pooling = Lot of supporting resources are shared across multiple tenants.
    - Rapid Elasticity = ability to scale up and down immediately whenever it is required.
    - Measured Service = pay as u go or pay for what you use.

Cloud computing service models
    SAAS
    PAAS
    IAAS (aws is infrastructure as a service model)


Global Infrastructure
    Regions
        currently 14 available regions. regions are primary building blocks of aws, cost of services
        varies across different regions.

    Availability zones
        collection of data centers. every region has atleast two availability zones. connected with private
        fiber are key to high availability and fault tolerance.

    Edge locations
        it serve two aws services

            1. Amazon cloud front. (aws cdn)
            2. route 53
        Edge locations stand on their own.

    Scope of services
        1. Global services
        2. Regional services
        3. Availability zone services
